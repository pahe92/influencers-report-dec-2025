### **SECTION 4: THE STRATEGY**
**What We Did Right (And What We Learned)**

#### **Copy:**

**The Playbook That Got Us Here**

Success isn't luck—it's strategy. Here's what worked:

**✅ Platform Diversification**
- **Instagram-first approach (61%):** Leveraged Reels for discovery, Stories for trust-building
- **TikTok expansion (26%):** Tapped into viral trends (#MyBambuStory, #DineroSeguro)
- **Facebook stability (12%):** Reached older demographic, family decision-makers
- **YouTube experiment (1%):** Tested long-form content (low volume, learning phase)

**✅ Content Themes That Convert**
Based on view count and engagement analysis, these topics drove best performance:

1. **International Money Transfers (IMT)** — "How to send money to Venezuela with $0 fees"
2. **Account Opening** — "Open account in 5 minutes, no credit check"
3. **Direct Deposit** — "Get paid 2 days early with MyBambu"
4. **MyBambu Card Benefits** — "Cashback on everything you buy"
5. **Real Customer Stories** — "How MyBambu changed my family's life"

**✅ Geographic Targeting**
- **Primary markets (highest engagement):** Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina
- **Growing markets:** Cuba, Ecuador, Peru, Dominican Republic
- **Emerging markets:** Central America (Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador)
- **US Hispanic hubs:** Miami (Venezuelan community), NYC (Dominican/Puerto Rican), LA (Mexican/Central American)

**✅ Creator Segmentation Strategy**
- **Mega-influencers (1M+ followers):** 5 partnerships = 40% of total views (Antonia Botero, Hormazatv, etc.)
- **Macro-influencers (100K-1M):** 25 partnerships = 35% of views
- **Micro-influencers (10K-100K):** 100 partnerships = 20% of views (higher engagement rates)
- **Nano-influencers (<10K):** 70 partnerships = 5% of views (hyper-local community trust)

**🔍 What We Learned:**

**Lesson 1: Quality > Quantity**
2025's 100K average views/video (vs 2024's 89K) came from better creator vetting. We stopped working with low-performing influencers and reinvested in proven partners.

**Lesson 2: Engagement ≠ Reach**
2024's 4.13% engagement beat 2025's 0.83% because 2024 focused on niche, highly engaged communities. 2025 prioritized scale. **2026 goal:** Optimize for both.

**Lesson 3: Platform Matters**
TikTok drives younger users (18-34), Instagram reaches families (25-45), Facebook converts older demographics (35-55). **2026 strategy:** Match creator to platform to audience lifecycle.

**🚀 8 Strategic Initiatives to Get There**

**Initiative 1: Double Down on Top Performers**
**What:** Offer annual contracts to top 10 creators with guaranteed monthly content + performance bonuses
**Why:** Top 3 creators = 47% of views. Secure them before competitors do.

**Expected ROI:** 80-100% increase in Gen Z account sign-ups

**Initiative 3: Geographic Expansion in Underserved Markets**

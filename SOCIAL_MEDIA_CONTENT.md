**Copy:**
```
After managing 200+ Hispanic influencer partnerships, here's what I learned:

1️⃣ Authentic customer stories get 6.3% engagement.
   Product-focused content? Only 3.7%.
   → Lesson: People want testimonials, not ads.

2️⃣ Top 3 creators = 47% of total views.
   → Lesson: Concentration beats diversification.

3️⃣ TikTok engagement beats Instagram by 40%.
   → Lesson: Platform matters more than follower count.

4️⃣ Venezuelan creators dominate performance.
   → Lesson: Target communities with highest remittance needs.

5️⃣ Zero attribution tracking = flying blind.
   → Lesson: Unique promo codes per creator is non-negotiable.

### **Post 3: Story-Driven (Emotional Connection)**

**Copy:**
```
"How do you reach the unbanked?"

That was the challenge when I started building MyBambu's influencer program in 2023.

Traditional ads don't work. This community doesn't trust banks. They've been burned before.

So we tried something different: partner with 200+ Latino creators who *are* the community.

Antonia Botero sharing how she sends money to Venezuela with $0 fees.
Hormazatv making financial education funny and relatable.
Yoaibimar showing how direct deposit changed her life.

Real people. Real stories. Real trust.

The results?
→ 100M+ views
→ 4.39M engagements
→ 17 markets reached
→ 4x better engagement than industry average

This isn't influencer marketing. It's community building.

And in 2026, we're scaling it to 300M+ views.

**Tweet 1:**
```
🧵 MyBambu's influencer marketing just hit 100M+ views.

Here's the 10-tweet breakdown of what $[X] bought us (and the 3 mistakes we made):
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
1/ THE NUMBERS

✅ 100M+ total views
✅ 4.39M engagements
✅ 4.39% engagement rate (4x industry avg)
✅ 200+ Latino creator partnerships
✅ +56% YoY growth

Influencer marketing is now our #1 Hispanic brand awareness channel.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
2/ THE WINNERS

Top 3 creators drove 47% of total views:

🥇 Antonia Botero: 20M views
🥈 Hormazatv: 4.4M views
🥉 Yoaibimar Daal Daal: 3.5M views

Lesson: Invest 60% of budget in proven mega-influencers.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
3/ CONTENT THAT CONVERTS

Engagement by theme:
→ Customer stories: 6.3% 🏆
→ IMT tutorials: 5.2%
→ Account opening: 4.8%
→ Card promos: 3.7%

Authentic > promotional
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
4/ PLATFORM BREAKDOWN

📱 Instagram: 61% (best reach)
🎵 TikTok: 26% (fastest growth)
👍 Facebook: 12% (older demo)
▶️ YouTube: 1% (HUGE missed opportunity)

2026 strategy: Expand TikTok to 40% of content mix.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
5/ GEOGRAPHIC REACH

We reached 17 Latin American markets simultaneously:
🇻🇪 Venezuela
🇲🇽 Mexico
🇨🇴 Colombia
🇦🇷 Argentina
+ 13 more

This is impossible with traditional advertising.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
6/ MISTAKE #1: No attribution tracking

We can't prove which influencers drive actual sign-ups.

Fix: Unique promo codes per creator in 2026.

Example: ANTONIA25 = track every account Antonia Botero drives.
```

**Tweet 8:**
```
7/ MISTAKE #2: YouTube neglect

Only 1% of our content was YouTube.

Massive SEO miss. Long-form educational content drives higher conversion.

2026 plan: 10 YouTube videos (8-15 min each).
```

**Tweet 9:**
```
8/ MISTAKE #3: Scaled too fast

Engagement dropped from 4.13% (2024) to 0.83% (2025).

We added too many low-quality creators.

Fix: Cut underperformers, reinvest in proven winners.
```

**Tweet 10:**
```
9/ 2026 GOAL: 300M+ VIEWS

How we'll get there:
✅ Annual contracts with top 10 creators
✅ TikTok expansion (26% → 40%)
✅ Attribution tracking (unique links per creator)
✅ UGC campaigns (quarterly)

# MyBambu Influencer Marketing Report 2024-2025: How 200+ Hispanic Creators Generated 100M+ Views

**By Paula Hernandez, Head of Marketing Strategy | December 2025 | 15 min read**

MyBambu's influencer marketing program achieved unprecedented success in 2024-2025, generating over **100 million views** and **4.39 million engagements** through strategic partnerships with 200+ Hispanic content creators. This comprehensive performance report analyzes two years of influencer campaigns across Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube, revealing how authentic Latino creator partnerships drive measurable brand awareness, engagement, and customer acquisition in the Hispanic FinTech market.

## Executive Summary: The Numbers That Matter

In 24 months, MyBambu invested $[X] in creator partnerships and achieved:

- **100M+ total views** (equivalent to $[X]M in paid media reach)
- **4.39M total engagements** (likes, comments, shares, saves)
- **4.39% average engagement rate** (4x the industry benchmark of 1.2%)
- **200+ active creator partnerships** spanning mega, macro, micro, and nano influencers
- **+56% year-over-year growth** (38.8M views in 2024 → 60.4M views in 2025)
- **17 Latin American markets** reached simultaneously

Our data-driven insights demonstrate that influencer marketing delivers exponentially better engagement rates than traditional advertising when content is culturally relevant, creator selection is strategic, and platform distribution is optimized for target demographics.

## Key Finding #1: Concentration Strategy Wins

The most critical insight from our analysis? **Top 3 creators drove 47% of total 2024 views.**

Antonia Botero alone generated 20 million combined views across 2024-2025, proving that mega-influencer partnerships with authentic community connections deliver consistent ROI. This concentration effect challenges the conventional wisdom of diversifying across many small creators—our data shows investing 60% of budget in proven top performers yields better results than spreading budget thinly.

## 2024-2025 Performance & 2026 Strategy

**Presented by:** Paula Hernandez
Head of Marketing Strategy & Strategic Partnerships

**Date:** December 2025

**Speaker Notes:**
"Good morning. Today I'm presenting our influencer marketing performance from the past two years and our strategic plan to scale this success in 2026. This has become our highest-ROI customer acquisition channel, and the data proves it."

## SLIDE 2: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Visual:** 4 stat cards (glass morphism style, green accents)

### **Main Text:**
# The Bottom Line

**MyBambu's influencer strategy delivered:**

- **100M+ views** across 1,034 videos
- **4.39M engagements** (4x industry average)
- **200+ creator partnerships** in 17 markets
- **+56% YoY growth** with accelerating momentum

### **Key Takeaway:**
Influencer marketing is now our #1 brand awareness channel for Hispanic audiences.

**Speaker Notes:**
"In two years, we've built an influencer program that reached 100 million people. That's equivalent to [$X million] in paid media, but with higher trust and better engagement. Our 4.39% engagement rate is 4 times the industry average—meaning our audience isn't just seeing MyBambu, they're actively engaging with it."

## SLIDE 3: 2024 VS 2025 COMPARISON

**Visual:** Side-by-side bar charts (green for 2024, blue for 2025)

### **Main Text:**
# Year-Over-Year Growth

| Metric | 2024 | 2025 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Total Views** | 38.8M | 60.4M | **+56%** ✅ |
| **Videos Published** | 432 | 602 | **+39%** ✅ |
| **Avg Views/Video** | 89,709 | 100,268 | **+12%** ✅ |
| **Engagement Rate** | 4.13% | 0.83% | **-80%** 🚨 |

### **Key Insight:**
We scaled reach effectively but need to re-optimize for engagement in 2026.

**Speaker Notes:**
"We're growing fast—56% more views, 39% more content. Quality improved too: each video in 2025 averaged 100K views vs 89K in 2024. The red flag? Engagement dropped from 4.13% to 0.83% because we scaled too broadly. 2026 strategy addresses this: we're doubling down on proven high-engagement creators."

## SLIDE 4: TOP PERFORMERS ANALYSIS

**Visual:** Podium graphic with top 3 creators (gold/silver/bronze cards)

### **Main Text:**
# Who Drives Results?

### **Top 3 Creators = 47% of Total Views**

**🥇 Antonia Botero**
- 20M combined views (10.4M + 9.6M)
- Venezuelan mega-influencer, family-focused content
- **Why she works:** Authentic storytelling, loyal audience

**🥈 Hormazatv**
- 4.4M views (2024)
- Comedy-driven financial education
- **Why he works:** Highly shareable, male Latino perspective

**🥉 Yoaibimar Daal Daal**
- 3.5M views (2024)
- Young professional, aspirational lifestyle
- **Why she works:** "Get paid early" messaging resonates

### **Strategic Implication:**
Invest 60% of budget in top 10 proven performers.

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's a critical finding: just 3 creators drove almost half our views. This isn't a failure—it's a roadmap. We now know exactly who delivers ROI. In 2026, we're offering annual contracts to our top 10 to secure them before competitors do. This concentration strategy works."

## SLIDE 5: PLATFORM PERFORMANCE

**Visual:** Donut chart showing platform distribution

### **Main Text:**
# Platform Mix & Strategy

**Current Distribution:**
- **📱 Instagram: 61%** — Reels/Stories, best reach
- **🎵 TikTok: 26%** — Fastest-growing, viral potential
- **👍 Facebook: 12%** — Older demo, family sharing
- **▶️ YouTube: 1%** — Underutilized SEO opportunity

### **Key Findings:**
- TikTok = youngest audience (18-34), highest viral potential
- Instagram = broad reach (25-45), family decision-makers
- YouTube = massive SEO gap (only 3 videos in 2 years!)

### **2026 Strategy:**
Expand TikTok from 26% → 40% of content mix

**Speaker Notes:**
"Instagram is our workhorse—61% of content, strong performance. But TikTok is where growth is happening. It's our fastest-growing platform with the youngest users. We're underweight on TikTok. By shifting to 40% TikTok content in 2026, we tap into Gen Z account acquisition. And YouTube? Massive missed opportunity—only 1% of our content but huge SEO value."

## SLIDE 6: CONTENT THEMES THAT CONVERT

**Visual:** Horizontal bar chart showing engagement by content theme

### **Main Text:**
# What Content Works?

**Engagement Rate by Content Theme:**

1. **Customer Stories** → 6.3% 🏆
2. **IMT Tutorials** → 5.2%
3. **Account Opening** → 4.8%
4. **Direct Deposit** → 4.1%
5. **Card Benefits** → 3.7%

### **Key Insight:**
Authentic storytelling (customer testimonials) beats product pitches by 70%.

### **Top-Performing Videos:**
- "How I send money to Venezuela with $0 fees"
- "Opening my first US bank account (no credit check)"
- "Getting paid 2 days early changed my life"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Data doesn't lie: authentic customer stories get 6.3% engagement—our highest. Product-focused content? Only 3.7%. This tells us people don't want ads, they want real experiences. In 2026, we're doubling down on testimonial-style content and launching UGC campaigns to generate hundreds of authentic customer stories at scale."

## SLIDE 7: GEOGRAPHIC REACH

**Visual:** Heat map of Latin America with pin drops

### **Main Text:**
# 17 Markets Reached Simultaneously

**Primary Markets (highest engagement):**
- 🇻🇪 Venezuela
- 🇲🇽 Mexico
- 🇨🇴 Colombia
- 🇦🇷 Argentina

**Growing Markets:**
- 🇨🇺 Cuba | 🇪🇨 Ecuador | 🇵🇪 Peru | 🇩🇴 Dominican Republic

**US Hispanic Hubs:**
- 🏙️ Miami | NYC | LA | Houston | Chicago

### **2026 Expansion:**
Recruit 20 local micro-influencers in Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador

**Speaker Notes:**
"We're not just reaching US Hispanics—we're building brand awareness across 17 Latin American countries. Venezuela, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina are our core. But there's massive opportunity in underserved markets like Peru and Ecuador. In 2026, we're recruiting local micro-influencers who understand these markets deeply. This gives us cultural relevance you can't buy with paid ads."

## SLIDE 8: CRITICAL GAPS WE MUST FIX

**Visual:** Red warning boxes for each gap

### **Main Text:**
# 3 Critical Problems (And Our Solutions)

**❌ PROBLEM 1: No Attribution Tracking**
- **Impact:** Can't prove direct customer acquisition
- **Solution:** Unique links + promo codes per creator
- **Investment:** $[X] (tracking technology)

**❌ PROBLEM 2: YouTube Underutilized**
- **Impact:** Missing SEO opportunity, low long-form content
- **Solution:** 10 educational videos (8-15 min each)
- **Investment:** $[X] (creator partnerships)

**❌ PROBLEM 3: Engagement Dropped 80% in 2025**
- **Impact:** Scaled too broadly, lost high-engagement niche
- **Solution:** Re-focus on proven top performers + micro-influencers
- **Investment:** Shift budget from underperformers to top 10

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let's be honest about what's not working. First, we have zero attribution tracking—we can't prove which influencers drive actual sign-ups. That changes in 2026 with unique links for every creator. Second, YouTube is a ghost town for us—only 1% of content. We're missing massive SEO value. Third, engagement cratered in 2025 because we scaled too fast. We're fixing this by cutting underperformers and reinvesting in proven winners."

## SLIDE 9: 2026 STRATEGIC ROADMAP

**Visual:** Timeline with Q1-Q4 milestones

### **Main Text:**
# 2026 Game Plan: 8 Strategic Initiatives

**Top 3 Must-Win Initiatives:**

### **1. Lock Down Top Performers**
- Annual contracts with top 10 creators
- **Expected ROI:** +50-60% total views

### **2. Expand TikTok to 40%**
- Launch branded hashtag challenge #MyBambuChallenge
- **Expected ROI:** +80-100% Gen Z sign-ups

### **3. Implement Attribution Tracking**
- Unique links + promo codes per creator
- **Expected ROI:** Prove direct customer acquisition

**Additional Initiatives:**
4. Geographic expansion (Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador)
5. YouTube long-form strategy (10 educational videos)
6. Brand Ambassador program (15 creators)
7. UGC campaigns (quarterly, $2K prize pool each)
8. Financial literacy content series

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's our 2026 playbook. Eight initiatives, but three are non-negotiable: lock down our top performers before competitors steal them, expand TikTok to capture Gen Z, and finally implement attribution tracking so we can prove ROI. The other five initiatives support these core bets. If we execute all eight, we hit 300M views in 2026. But if budget is tight, we can win with just the top 3."

## SLIDE 10: 2026 AMBITIOUS GOALS

**Visual:** Comparison table with 2025 actual vs 2026 targets

### **Main Text:**
# What Success Looks Like in 2026

| Metric | 2025 Actual | 2026 Target | Growth |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Total Views** | 60.4M | 150M | **+148%** |
| **Engagement Rate** | 0.83% | 3.5% | **+322%** |
| **Active Creators** | 200+ | 350+ | **+75%** |
| **Markets Covered** | 17 | 25 | **+47%** |
| **Attribution** | 0% | 100% | **New** |

### **The Vision:**
From 100M views in 2 years → 300M+ views with direct attribution to customer acquisition.

**Speaker Notes:**
"These aren't wishful targets—they're achievable based on our 2024-2025 trajectory. We've proven 56% YoY growth is possible. Hitting 150M views requires executing our TikTok expansion and top performer strategy. The 3.5% engagement target? That's still below our 2024 peak of 4.13%, so it's realistic. And 100% attribution tracking is table stakes—we simply must prove which influencers drive sign-ups."

## SLIDE 11: BUDGET REQUEST & ROI

**Visual:** Budget table with 2025 vs 2026 comparison

### **Main Text:**
# What We Need to Make This Happen

**2026 Budget Request:**

| Category | 2025 | 2026 Request | Increase |
|----------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Creator Payments** | $[X] | $[X] | **+[%]** |
| **Attribution Tech** | $0 | $[X] | **New** |
| **UGC Prize Pool** | $0 | $8K | **New** |
| **TOTAL BUDGET** | **$[X]** | **$[X]** | **+[%]** |

**Headcount Request:**
- **1 FTE:** Influencer Marketing Manager
- **0.5 FTE:** Data Analyst (attribution tracking)

### **Expected ROI:**
- $[X] investment → 150M views → [X,XXX] estimated sign-ups at $[X] CPA
- **Projected customer acquisition:** [X]% of total new accounts from influencer channel

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's the ask: $[X] total budget, up [%] from 2025. The biggest new line item is attribution tracking technology—critical for proving ROI. We're also requesting 1.5 FTEs: an Influencer Manager to handle 200+ partnerships, and a part-time Data Analyst to build our attribution dashboard. The ROI? Based on industry benchmarks, 150M views should drive [X,XXX] account sign-ups at $[X] cost per acquisition. That's [%] cheaper than Facebook Ads and far more trusted."

## SLIDE 12: DECISION & NEXT STEPS

**Visual:** 3 decision boxes (Yes/No checkboxes)

### **Main Text:**
# What We Need from Leadership

**🎯 3 Decisions Required:**

**1. Budget Approval**
→ Approve $[X] for 2026 influencer marketing?
→ ☐ Yes ☐ No

**2. Headcount Approval**
→ Greenlight 1 FTE Influencer Manager hire?
→ ☐ Yes ☐ No

**3. Strategic Alignment**
→ Prioritize Top Performers + TikTok + Attribution as core focus?
→ ☐ Yes ☐ No

### **If Yes to All 3:**
✅ We scale to 300M+ views in 2026
✅ We prove direct customer acquisition from influencer channel
✅ MyBambu becomes the Hispanic FinTech leader in creator marketing

### **If No:**
❌ Current success plateaus
❌ Competitors catch up (Chime, Current, Dave all launching Hispanic influencer programs)
❌ We lose top creators to better-funded competitors

**Speaker Notes:**
"I need three decisions from this group today. One: budget approval for $[X]. Two: headcount for an Influencer Manager—we simply can't scale 200+ partnerships without dedicated ownership. Three: strategic alignment that Top Performers + TikTok + Attribution are our core bets. If you say yes to all three, we're positioned to dominate Hispanic FinTech influencer marketing. If no, we plateau while competitors catch up. What questions do you have?"

## BACKUP SLIDE 2: COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

**Visual:** Competitor comparison table

### **Main Text:**
# Why We Must Act Now: Competitive Threats

**Hispanic FinTech Influencer Marketing Activity (2025):**

| Competitor | Influencer Program | Scale | Threat Level |
|------------|-------------------|-------|--------------|
| **Chime** | Launched Q3 2025 | 50+ creators | 🔴 High |
| **Current** | Testing phase | 20+ creators | 🟡 Medium |
| **Dave** | Early stage | 10+ creators | 🟡 Medium |
| **Ualá** | Latin America focus | 100+ creators | 🟠 Medium-High |
| **MyBambu** | **Established leader** | **200+ creators** | ✅ **Leading** |

### **Our Advantage:**
- 2 years head start
- Proven creator relationships
- Deep Hispanic market expertise

### **Risk If We Don't Scale:**
Competitors will recruit our top performers with higher budgets.

**Speaker Notes:**
"We're not alone anymore. Chime launched a Hispanic influencer program in Q3 2025 with 50+ creators. Current and Dave are testing. If we don't lock down our top performers NOW with annual contracts, they'll get outbid. We have a 2-year head start—let's use it before competitors catch up."

## BACKUP SLIDE 3: ATTRIBUTION TRACKING MOCKUP

**Visual:** Dashboard screenshot mockup showing attribution metrics

### **Main Text:**
# What Attribution Tracking Looks Like

**Creator Performance Dashboard (Coming 2026):**

**Metrics We'll Track:**
- Account sign-ups by creator (using unique promo codes)
- Card activations by creator cohort
- First transaction volume by creator
- Customer lifetime value by influencer tier
- Cost per acquisition by creator

**Sample Insight:**
"Antonia Botero drove 10.4M views → 2,500 sign-ups → $125K first-year transaction volume → $50 CPA (vs $85 Facebook Ads CPA)"

### **Technology Stack:**
- Unique UTM tracking links per creator
- Branded promo codes (e.g., ANTONIA25)
- [Tool name] attribution platform
- Custom Looker dashboard for real-time reporting

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is what we're building in 2026. Right now, we know Antonia Botero got 10M views, but we can't prove she drove a single sign-up. With attribution tracking, we'll know exactly how many accounts each creator generates, their transaction volume, and true cost per acquisition. This transforms influencer marketing from 'nice to have brand awareness' into a measurable customer acquisition channel."

## PRESENTATION DELIVERY TIPS

**Opening (Slides 1-2):**
- Start strong with the headline: "100M views, 4.39M engagements, 4x industry engagement rate"
- Set expectation: "This is now our #1 Hispanic brand awareness channel"

**Middle (Slides 3-8):**
- Use data storytelling: "Here's what worked, here's what didn't, here's how we fix it"
- Be honest about gaps (engagement drop, no attribution)
- Emphasize competitive threats if leadership seems hesitant

**Close (Slides 9-12):**
- Build urgency: "Competitors are launching programs now. We must act."
- Make the ask clear: Budget, headcount, strategic alignment
- End with confidence: "If we execute this plan, MyBambu becomes the undisputed Hispanic FinTech influencer marketing leader"

**Q&A Preparation:**
- **"Can you prove ROI?"** → "Not yet, which is why attribution tracking is critical. But 4.39% engagement vs 1.2% industry avg suggests strong performance."
- **"Why did engagement drop in 2025?"** → "We scaled too fast, too broadly. 2026 strategy re-focuses on proven high-engagement creators."
- **"What if top creators say no to annual contracts?"** → "We've had preliminary conversations. They want stability too. We're the established partner."
- **"Can we afford to lose?"** → "Chime and Current are recruiting our creators. If we don't lock them down, we will lose them."
